# U-Pb-isotope-simulation-and-sampling
This is a python script that calculates the U-Pb isotopic model formed by mixing common Pb at different ratios by setting the mineral age age and 206Pb counts, and simulates the sampling analysis according to the WRS（Weighted Random Sampling） method.


agen=100  indicates the age of data generation (million years)
